## Template A: AI Model Provider
Subject: Official AI Partner for enXross Cohort in {{cohort_city}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I am reaching out because enXross is selecting one Official AI Partner for our next cohort in {{cohort_city}} ({{cohort_date_window}}).

Why this is a fit for {{company}}:
- Direct access to builders shipping production AI use cases, not just hack projects.
- Category ownership: your brand positioned as the default AI stack across the cohort.
- Measurable outcomes: model credits activated, MAU of shipped agents, retained teams after demo day.

We are not looking for a logo placement sponsor. We are structuring one flagship partnership with product adoption targets tied to your APAC goals.

If useful, I can send a 1-page executive brief and a concrete activation plan this week.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call?

## Template B: L1 Chain
Subject: One flagship APAC L1 partnership seat for enXross

Hi {{first_name}},

enXross is finalizing one Official L1 Partner for our next cohort in {{cohort_city}} ({{cohort_date_window}}).

I am contacting you specifically because your mandate at {{company}} aligns with what we are building: sustained on-chain activity from serious builder teams in APAC.

What the partnership is designed to deliver:
- Qualified pipeline of teams deploying on your chain.
- Transaction and active wallet growth from real products.
- Narrative leadership: {{company}} positioned as the execution layer for this cohort.

We can structure milestones around metrics your team already tracks (deployments, retained developers, active contracts, transaction growth).

Open to a focused 20-minute call to review structure and ROI model?

## Template C: XR Platform / Spatial Computing
Subject: Official XR Partner opportunity for enXross (APAC)

Hi {{first_name}},

I am reaching out because enXross is selecting one Official XR Partner for our upcoming APAC cohort in {{cohort_city}}.

This partnership is built for decision-makers who care about product usage and category leadership, not passive event sponsorship.

What {{company}} would get:
- First access to founder teams building spatial experiences in market.
- Product-native activations that put your hardware/software in live workflows.
- Outcome reporting tied to demos shipped, usage depth, and post-cohort adoption.

If relevant, I can share a board-ready sponsor brief and activation map tailored to your APAC growth priorities.

Would next week work for a 20-minute conversation?

## Template D: Housing Partner
Subject: Official Housing Partner for enXross Cohort in {{cohort_city}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I am reaching out because enXross is selecting one **Official Housing Partner** for our next cohort in {{cohort_city}} ({{cohort_date_window}}).

enXross is a six-month startup residency inside Tokyo Dome City, designed to help founder teams build and launch products in market.

What this partnership is designed to deliver for {{company}}:
- Default placement: the recommended stay option for founders, mentors, and visiting partners (multi-month room nights).
- Brand ownership: positioned as the official residence partner for the cohort (not a logo-only sponsorship).
- Measurable outcomes: inquiries, booked room nights, and long-stay conversions tracked cohort-wide.

If useful, I can send a 1-page executive brief and a concrete activation plan (inventory, rates, and projected room nights) this week.

## Follow-up #1 (3-4 business days later)
Subject: Re: Official {{track}} Partner for enXross

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick follow-up in case this is relevant to your APAC planning.

We have one official partner seat for {{track}} and are prioritizing partners who want measurable adoption outcomes, not visibility-only sponsorship.

If helpful, I can send the 1-page brief first so you can decide if a call is worth it.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

## Follow-up #2 (5-7 business days later)
Subject: Close loop: enXross x {{company}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Closing the loop on this.

If this is not in your remit, could you point me to the owner for APAC partnerships/sponsorships? I can send a concise brief and keep it efficient.

Thanks,

## LinkedIn DM version (short)
Hi {{first_name}} - we are selecting one Official {{track}} Partner for the next enXross APAC cohort. This is an adoption-focused sponsorship (builder pipeline + measurable outcomes), not logo placement. Open to a 20-minute chat next week?
